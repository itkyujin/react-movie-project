## Assignment3, My Favorite Movie's React App 


# Select a theme/trending topic/industry for your application.
- I usually enjoy watching a lot of movies through the website or mobile app. I wanted to make a website using the React framework to add various movies, including Korean dramas, and simply view the contents.

The title is My Favorite Movies website, and my favorite movies are stored as collections in MongoDB as a database and displayed on a web page through Node.js.
And the movie data is configured as a site so that other movies can be searched and found in addition through APIs provided free of charge.

I chose the React framework as my Assignment 3 because it is the most widely used, so I chose it because I thought it would be the most advantageous in preparing for a job. And I decided that I could easily find a lot of resources and a lot of references that could help me.
Thank you
